        """Create a 3D object, like a planet, a star, or a spaceship, using
        vpython and return it. It will be rotated etc. elsewhere, don't worry
        about that. Just make a cool object!

        Note when drawing new fancy objects and when you eventually use the
        vpython.compound object:
        To make a vpython.compound object (say, obj = vpython.compound(shapes))
        have a length equal to the size of an entity's diameter, you'll end up
        setting obj.length = entity.r * 2, or something similar.
        But the shapes that you wrap in the vpython.compound object will also
        be stretched in unexpected ways. If you can't make sense of it,
        consider the following example:

        a = vpython.cylinder(length=1)
        b = vpython.sphere(radius=0.2)
        compound = vpython.compound([a, b])
        compound.length = my_length

        will visually look exactly the same as if `a` and `b` both had exactly
        ten times the length and radius, or thirty times the length and radius.
        The dimensions of the individual shapes in a compound object don't
        matter, it's the _proportion_ of the shapes to each other.
